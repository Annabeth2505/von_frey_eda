Analysis of mechanical sensitivity data from von Frey filament tests conducted on rats post chronic compression of Dorsal Root Ganglion surgery. 

## Structure 
- `data/`: information about the dataset used and instructions on how to structure your data for easy reproducibility 
- `notebooks/`: R notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `results/`: plots and model outputs
- `report/`: final report

## Analysis 
- Used linear mixed effects models to assess sensitivity changes over time
- Evaluated pre vs. post-surgical force thresholds
- Modeled individual rat trajectories and population trends

## R packages used
- `lme4`, `MuMIn`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `splines`
